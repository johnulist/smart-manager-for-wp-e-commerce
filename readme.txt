Smart Manager is a unique, revolutionary tool that gives you the **power to efficiently manage products, customers 
and orders** using the popular WordPress e-Commerce plugin from GetShopped / Instinct.

As a business owner, **your time is better spent on marketing and customer service** than on store administration. 
Unfortunately store administration with WordPress e-Commerce can take significant time. Day after day.

Smart Manager will **boost your productivity 10x** in managing products, customers and orders. You can browse, 
search, and manage multiple products, customers or orders using a **familiar, single page, 
spreadsheet like** interface. 

The Pro version also allows inline editing for all fields and adding items. It also provides 
**Smart Batch Update** to change multiple fields on multiple items - all **at once with zero errors**. 
You will discover a new way of store administration with this add-on. 

It frees you up from mundane housekeeping tasks. So you can spend that time on anything that makes you more 
money. Use that time to leverage social media for higher sales, or develop deeper customer relationships. 
Use that time to develop a new product, or simply present it to your family.

limited inline editing for products and orders, ability to delete multiple items at 
once, a quick edit link to WP e-Commerce editing screen.
